# CopyfromPDF
If you are copying a lot of text from PDF files and pasting into your text editor, such as Word, Obsidian or LogSeq, and you are bothered with line breaks; just run this on the background.

## To Run
```pip install keyboard pyperclip```
and run the code.

## If you want to make .exe file
```pip install pyinstaller```
and
```pyinstaller --onefile copypastev2.py``` 

## Upcoming Features and Bugfixed
- I am aware of the program not working as intended while copying from HTML. Will look into it ASAP.
- I want to add a timer log where it will show how much time did you spend working on a project.
- I dont intend to create a GUI but I want to add some functionality to turn it on and off with hotkeys. Better CLI is my aim.

## For Total Beginners
- Open VSCode. 
- Choose the directory of this .py file inside the VSCode GUI, or in terminal.
- Run the code to make sure it works.
- Follow to steps above.
- Look at the directory, there should now be a file called dist.
- Copyfrompdfv2.exe should be there.
